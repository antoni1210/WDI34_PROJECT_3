- Use RESTful routing
- Consume a third-party API and render information from it on the front-end
- Feature authentication to grant access for users
- Incorporate back-end testing
- Be deployed online so that it can be accessed publicly

### Trello

This was my first time using a Trello board and I found it incredibly useful to keep on top of tasks and proritise them, which was especially valuable when working as part of a team.

### Challenges and issues

- We tried to use Citymapper's API to return directions based on users location, however it consumed a lot of time so we ditched it and used Google's Maps and Places Autocomplete API instead.
- It took me a long time to figure out how to disable the voting feature after a user had already submitted their vote

### Wins

- Even though this was our first group project, we quickly came to an agreement on the app we wanted to create and what we wanted to achieve.
- Getting the reviews section working.

### Future developments and tweaks

- Incorporating an API that can provide directions based on users location, such as Citymapper.
- Revisit some of the styling and go for a more neutral look.
